# Core Rules

## Constraints
- Read before editing. Never modify unread files.
- One task at a time. Complete fully before starting next.
- No over-engineering. Solve what's asked, nothing more.
- Security: validate inputs, no hardcoded secrets, parameterized queries.

## Git
- Never commit unless asked. Use conventional commits.
- Never force push main/master. Never skip hooks.
- Always sign commits when configured.

## Testing
- Run tests after changes. Fix before committing.
- Match existing test patterns.

## Operating Modes
- Default: code + test. Use /auto-pilot for autonomous work.
- Use /plan-day to structure work sessions.
